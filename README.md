Hello, I'm Lucas and I'm looking for my first job opportunity as a front-end developer. I've been studying HTML, CSS and JavaScript in a self-taught way(through books, documentation, videos and exercises). I also have a technology degree in software development and analysis.

Thank you for visiting my repository.
